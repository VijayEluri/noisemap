### Description

To run this application, you have to be located inside the [Rolex Learning Center](http://rolexlearningcenter.epfl.ch/).
The client application measures the noise intensity of your microphone and the BSSID of the nearest router in terms of signal strength. The server collects that information and displays it as an overlay over an indoor map of the library.

It has a minimal user interface with an overlaid map and a menu to start/stop measuring.

The application is not currently maintained and it is released under LGPL.

### Development

It requires google APIs of android 2.1 and an emulator with resolution 240X320.
